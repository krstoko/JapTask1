# Built with

This application is built with: 
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Asp.net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

# Instructions to start application

First what we need to do is to on my  [github  account](https://github.com/krstoko/JapTask1) and copy url so we can clone project after that.
After you copied url open you [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download), and with command `git clone + url` we will clone project on our machine.
When git finish cloning our project we will open [visual studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and navigate to our project.
There are frontend folder and backend folder and we will explain what to do with each of them so dont worry.

## Frontend

Now we can navigate into our frontend folder. When you do that we will use terminal to install all packages needed for our application to work.
All you need to do is to open terminal and use command `npm install`. That will take couple of sacond and after its done, all we need to do
is to use our start command. We will do that by using `npm start`.

*Please dont start frontend untill we start our backend as well*
